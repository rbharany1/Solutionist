Angular WebAPI site
Site built using VS2019

Please download and run in IDE as this application is set up to use IIS Express

Also I have noticed that the site take over a minute to load.
I can see that the main time is being taken by 2 components which seem to be angular components

* vendor.js
* zon-evergreen.js

As I am a newbie at Angular I am not sure if this is expected behaviour or if not, how to mitigate this to let the site load faster.
